                            <p>today I have told myself how much I dare not to think I love you. Quite frankly, I am not sure what Love is if we exclude how many times God said he would never leave me. That is if you believe in a God. I believe he has made me but maybe, after the many times I replayed you as mine that it would just be dust swept out the back door.

                            <p>I ALSO THANK THE LORD for the many girls that I know who love their color.</p>
                            <p>It makes me beyond happy when a girl knows black comes in many shades, because there are never really any limits to beauty. I get overly excited when we talk about black power, black beauty, melanin and the freakin' best hair tips I could ever get. Ever. Also also also, the way these girls who have "maintained" their hair for so long eventually choose to go natural. I know the process is SUPER hard, but you'll thank yourself in due time, your baby girl or little girls that know you will thank you in many ways, your precious hair will thank you etc. I know after meeting you all, I don't fear the future times, Gods willing, that I have to comb my child's hair. You know the deal. Anyway, I'm really also glad for you all to be accepting me despite my skin color, the years of proving to people that I am not who I look like. Its like, HARD, telling people that more than half of my family is black and brown- I just came out really white 🙃. The only thing we are overcoming now is realizing I can't really, you know, tan. Anyway, I LOVE MY QUEENS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU MELANIN POPPIN' SWEET BERRIES SKIN SO GOOD I SWEAR I SEE DIAMONDS typa girls. Love you all, that is all.</p>

                            <p>Humans are usually generalized.</p>
                            <p>The perfect image of we must look good to make within us happy is a paradox, a fools lie. We can smile and sort out our teeth arrays, how high must our cheek bones reach, how wide must our 'best smile' be</p>
                            <p>I am spiraling, hoping webs can web my feet following the right the direction of loving myself- me. ~if you think you have not found your purpose of how to make a wonderful batter of the world, gather your tools and thoughts to the idea of a whisk and how it is made. Then, how it is used and very much that, the manual side of things.</p>

                            <p>It was late afternoon, her eyes began to sink like the sunset she had a sunken chest, deep within her did she eventually breathe "hello". Hello, her name was Lola, the combination of the euphoria of an addicting drug and the discomfort of a broken home. He still chose to love her. He still chose to dive in despite the bees that had a hive and puffed smoked around her. Despite the many flaws that hung from the cracks of her lips and gave the color to her red eyes. He closed his lids and fell between her lips, the taste of soft Carmel candy, sugar daddy, teeth not neatly stacked like the way she smiled when she said "hello". Stunning studder, she never spoke before, "I have never seen someone like you." It took on her time that he- whore then but not now that</p>
                            <p>He eventually began to find her behind locked doors and under sheets, against glass doors and laid across white tiled floors. He found her behind trees and away from the lights. The scent of himself reminded her of wolves, would she satisfy his idea of charming love, silhouette love, lusting love because He thought that if He loved her enough, would the sparks within her flame again. Would he cause the blazing brown in her eyes turn dark red. Would he stir his coffee again with cinnamon, she is here no longer shall he need sugar to awaken him. Tea time Love she said, tea time love between the lines I wrote I say be my love. Be my love.</p>

                            <p>I would give you the world because I can see you hold the world itself on your shoulders.</p>
                            <p>I do not want to be a double burden. What if she could fold clothes, he thought more, I wonder if she cleans, if she does, with a plain white tee and shorts? Does she pin up her dark hair, does the sweat build up at her temple, condensing down her neck and between her breasts, her small breasts like the dripping of sweet milk from a sticky silver can. But, she always shook her head when he leaned in to touch lips.</p>
                            <p>If she could express words like how I wrote her name on the paper, he thought, the way I would stir my morning coffee and late night dream- I knew I had to hold her forever, even the times when she pushes me away I hope the same hands that she lets go of will always be behind her catching her when she fell back, when she fell down.</p>

                            <p>Her silence spoke images in his sky</p>
                            <p>Often like script words followed by beautiful shapes of her silhouette with the dense color of clouds, storm-less nights. Then he spoke. He spoke very little but with every word would it numb her past memory, the feeling of calm seas and a cool day after rain. With every word would he make his way into her genuine memory. Voice like soft leaf brussels going in circles, slowly around the ear- left a body of senses awakened at his touch of language.</p>

                            <p>Something he always saw in movies. The type where they wished at least once would every time that he would do it with a girl, would she, at last, be the one. Would she smile and shy away, face red as the flowers he would soon give her. He looked for her through cracks of doors and shaded windows, empty seats next to her would he be eager to find. Alone, he needed to know her for the first time other than what her eyes fed into his. Over grass and as the sun set, bobbing her head like she was skipping stones on the lake amidst her thoughts. She reminded him of what if felt to admit sin to God and believing that he fully understood why and forgave you. Something so common and unusual, the feeling of finding somewhere he could confide himself in, he could be away from it all, laying right next to her and her mellow hums- near silence.</p>
                            <p>Oh baby, he whispered in his thoughts, I felt this a million times, but not like this before..</p>

                            <p>Rhyme schemes and back bends the image of heavy laughter at young men who just want the pussy instead of problems. I tip my hat off to the woman who eventually leaves you in the pile of her cigarette buds.</p>

Compromised, where on that holy day my morals took rest and my body became holy, or whory I often get them confused. Sex played lead role in the temple, the catholic priest - it was my one and only desire, feed me these fruits of wickedness and wisdom, I reap what I sew, let the serpent be my guide. Let him lead me to my salvation and shall I be baptized into sexual slavery of the word 'Compromise'? ~~ a sinner who has now learned what it means to bend and play with temptation, what the difference is between fight and flee.

How I appreciate myself for not hating everyone who did me wrong, praying for everyone who entered and exited my life. I was a tomboy who believed in the manly behavior but was taught to be lady and conservative. I am becoming conservative I wear shorts a lot less and believe in not showing too much skin. Love yourself, anytime is the right time to love yourself and want to change for the better.</p>

                                <p>My heart and lungs are filled with black coal and grayish ashes forgotten to be tossed among healthy trees because ignorance is a contagious thing that still seems to be grown in the backyard</p>
                                <p>My ignorance is bright like the morning sun and we, matter of fact always close our weak eye squinting to see something pretty and cool in the 1pm hour</p>
                                <p>Hot sun huh, burn skin increase slave melanin mentality we do not know how these chains on our necks and wrists can stay on for centuries and found in more than one thing than hate of color</p>
                                <p>We do not know how we can treat other humans so</p>
                                <p>Yet we beat crying babies and spit on 'covered up' women who choose modesty over being seen more that skin under covered clothes coats of Joseph we speak to the guilty as they are scum we must learn how to scrape gum from under desks and tables and tell other it is not okay. The trash talk is not okay, and Jesus said he came to save the lame and sick, not the well. We all are sick in our own way and we, despite the money in the account or the precious food we eat, we are all sick in our head to believe we do not need help. Living in a godless fantasy is where the devil sits at the front desk to sell you entrance tickets for your own private playroom until your time is up. Excuse me if I have touched on topics we often skip in ethics class.</p>

That in awe of you I could love despite borders, despite timelines and blind spots and flaws and all that you say I should never love. All I can give is love, that raw, sweet honey love, that call your momma up and thank her love, that you let my heart beat to pieces type of love, love is my decision, that suckle sweet love, like sugar candy stuck in your rotten teeth, so sweet but you know the damage. It leaves a good taste in my mouth. The type of love I would change my life for, that unconditional and unlimited type of love. That love you profess to the daddy you don't know, the love you got for people who show up at your house that don't have a clue you were ready to die type of love. That love without drawn lines on yellow paper, without borders, maybe paper that never finished printing type of love. I wanna love, I wanna forgive and show you peace like God gives to me, that type of love.</p>

                                <p>I hate patterns of feelings</p>
                                <p>I hate rhyming</p>
                                <p>I hate including words in my poems that people might not even understand</p>
                                <p>I really don't like going deep</p>
                                <p>Just feel me on that slow mellow vibe ya feel me</p>
                                <p>I am in love with my soul mate so I write poetry that he can read.</p>
                                <p>I rather just play with words, and tell you exactly how I feel in that very moment. I rather just write for the sake of writing than to hear a compliment. This page is for my own pleasure, sometimes I can write good, if I actually spend more than a day on my poems 😂 i just free myself of what I feel</p>
                                <p>Ain't into that complicated, broken heart, corrupted childhood stuff...stuff on corrupted childhood soon come but yk...it is what it is. </p>
                                <p>I am afraid of showing myself through words</p>
                                <p>Poetry is personal</p>
                                <p>I rather offstage writing</p>
                                <p>To read my poetry, you gotta have some knowledge on sex, literature, religion and mental sickness. Least knowledge can come from love lol. Majority is knowing me because these names and quotes can be found all from things I read and watch and hear. I observe everything.</p>
                                <p>If you want to see work lemme know. Im just here chillin, enjoying my own vibe and writing.</p>
                                <p>P.s. If you haven't figured out the type of person I am, you prolly won't...ever.</p>

You have people who love you Lauren. But why but why can't they help me with what I feel inside?</p>
